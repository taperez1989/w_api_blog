Link to deployed sit:

This weeks challenge was to create a multiple pages for a blog post site. For this project it was designed to give me a better idea of what creating a project would be like in a real world scenario. I needed to create the page without any starter code and use javascript to enhance the pages capabilities.

Skills Implemented: HTML, CSS, Jvascript

To the best of my ability I started off with the basic HTML structure and started to build the site from there. Creating a form for users to input information that would be stored in local storage, from there I started to build my javascript file. I needed a way to get the information and store it in order to eventually pull it from local storage in the second page. I finished off the project with CSS styling.

Lessons learned:

This was a big challenge for me, there was so much that needed to be done and i felt a bit overwhelmed becuase I was unsure where I needed to start. Eventually, I settled on just starting with my HTML and begin to do the things I felt confident enough to do on my own. I then came to my first challenge which was writing a javascript code that would allow me to input information into a form in order to submit and be saved into local storage. I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure this out and eventually got som ething worked out with the assistance of classmates, tutors and TA assistance during office hours. There were plenty of moments that I felt completely lost but as I started to work the challenge with some assistance from tutors I began to understand the logic behind a bit more than when I first started. So thats progress in my opinion. With all the challenges I faced with this project I had a few moments of excitement as well. One being how I was able to get some javascript code started for local storage on my own and even though it was working exactly how I wanted it to, my tutor did assure me that I was on the right track and just need a little bit of adjustments with placement and variable labeling. So again it's a constant struggle but I am making progress.
